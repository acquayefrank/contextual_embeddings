In order to manage large files the actual data can be found [here](https://yadi.sk/d/0MtZBN4DfpyoSQ)

## Steps to track changes:

1. When done processing data kindly save it to yandex disk with the convention `data_<your_github_handle>_<current_iso_timestamp>` \
To obtain iso_timestap type the following code into the terminal:
```python
import datetime
str(datetime.datetime.now())
```
2. After merging your pull request into `main` copy the contents of your folder into `data_final` and delete your version of the data folder i.e the folder created in step 1.
