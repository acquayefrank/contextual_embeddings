One table for 50, 100, 200 and 300 ... Perhaps other gloves
One table for Word2Vec
One table for Fasttext

# Single Layered Neuron


Do for all features  and present AUC in a table 
Add data preperation and methodology 


Move --- AUC 
Act --- AUC 


Noun --- AUC 

# Try all embeddings

Thesis
(
There are more ways to train word vectors in Gensim than just Word2Vec. See also Doc2Vec, FastText and wrappers for VarEmbed and WordRank.
